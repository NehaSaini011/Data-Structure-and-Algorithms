### A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently

### Analogy
+ Array → like a row of drawers — fixed size, easy to find by number.
+ Linked list → like a chain — you go link by link.
+ Stack → like a stack of plates — last in, first out.
+ Queue → like a line at a ticket counter — first in, first out.
+ Tree → like a family tree — hierarchical.
+ Graph → like a map of cities connected by roads.

A data structure is a way to organize and store data so operations like searching, inserting, and deleting can be done efficiently.
Different data structures suit different problems — for instance, arrays are good for indexed access, linked lists for dynamic data, and stacks or queues for order-based operations.
Choosing the right data structure helps improve performance and makes the code cleaner.
